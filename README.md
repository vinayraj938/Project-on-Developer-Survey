# Exploratory Data Analysis of Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 dataset. The survey data includes responses from developers worldwide, capturing various aspects such as demographics, programming languages, employment status, job satisfaction, education, and other relevant topics. The primary goal of the project is to analyze the survey responses to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about the developer community.

The analysis begins with data loading and cleaning, followed by an exploration of key variables and relationships using statistical summaries and visualizations. The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the developer landscape based on the survey results, helping to identify common trends in the industry and inform stakeholders about the current state of software development globally.

Data Loading and Overview:

The initial step usually involves loading the dataset and having a first look at its structure, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and a preview of the first few rows.
Data Cleaning:

This section focuses on handling missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data. You might see operations like dropping missing values or filling them with mean/median, or handling outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical columns to understand the distribution.
Categorical Analysis: Frequency counts and visualizations (like bar plots) for categorical variables.
Visualizations: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore distributions and relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the analysis or prepare for modeling.
Insights and Findings:

Key takeaways from the data exploration, such as trends in developer preferences, salary distributions, popular technologies, etc.
Conclusions and Next Steps:

Summarizing findings and possibly suggesting further analysis or potential modeling techniques to predict or classify based on the survey data.
